[slugify]: http://stringjs.com/#methods/slugify

Nested headers are generated with the anchors being a combination of all parent headers located in the level array.
The nested headers must follow the correct hierarchy. No headers can be skipped, thus h1 directly to h3 will break anchoring.

The `renderPermalink` function takes the slug, an options object with
the above options, and then all the usual markdown-it rendering
arguments.

All headers above `level` will then have an `id` attribute with a slug
of their content. `level` can also be an array of headers levels to
apply the anchor, like `[2, 3]` to have an anchor on only level 2 and
3 headers.

If `permalink` is `true`, a `Â¶` symbol linking to the header itself will
be added.

You may want to use the [link symbol](http://graphemica.com/ðŸ”—) as
`permalinkSymbol`, or a symbol from your favorite web font.

The `callback` option is a function that will be called at the end of
rendering with the `token` and an `info` object.  The `info` object has
`title` and `slug` properties with the token content and the slug used
for the identifier.
